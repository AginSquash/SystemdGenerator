# Systemd Generator
With this simple program, you can quickly and easily create startup scripts/applications.

> Note, in some Linux distributions you have to specify the absolute path to each of the elements.
Example:
Use `/usr/bin/python3 /home/user_name/test.py` instead of `python /home/user_name/test.py`
